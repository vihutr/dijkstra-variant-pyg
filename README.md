alternative dijkstra implementation using incoming weights

only requires pygame-ce

you can run either script, main has more functionality and can be played around with more features, grid_dijkstra was a mvp demo and shows relatively quick performance with heapq even with larger grids (which should be more than the general use case of something like this)
